# Claude Code Plugin Development Challenge

## 🎯 The Challenge

Build a production-quality Claude Code plugin that enhances developer productivity and code quality at Smartr.

**Time Allocation**: 2-3 days

---

## 📋 Requirements

### Choose at least 3 components to implement:

1. **MCP Server** - Integrate with external systems (APIs, databases, tools)
2. **Commands** - Create slash commands for common tasks
3. **Skills** - Build reusable AI workflows with guards
4. **Subagents** - Create autonomous task executors
5. **Hooks** - Automate development workflows

## 🎓 What We're Evaluating

### Problem Selection (Critical)
- Does it solve a real developer pain point?
- Is the use case clear and valuable?
- Would developers actually use this?

### Implementation Quality
- Clean, maintainable code
- Proper error handling
- Well-structured and documented
- Production-ready

### AI Integration
- Thoughtful prompt design
- Appropriate use of AI capabilities
- Guards against common mistakes
- Clear success/failure criteria

### Developer Experience
- Intuitive to use
- Clear feedback and error messages
- Good documentation
- Examples provided

## 📦 Deliverables

1. **Working Plugin**
   - Complete `plugin.json` configuration
   - All implementation files
   - At least 3 components working

2. **Documentation** (Replace README.md with your own)
   - Problem statement - What does it solve?
   - Architecture - How does it work?
   - Installation & Usage - How to use it?
   - Demo - Show it working
   - Reflection - What would you improve?

3. **Demo**
   - Video walkthrough (preferred) OR
   - Detailed written walkthrough with screenshots
   - Show real-world usage scenarios

4. **(Optional) AI Prompts Log**
   - If you used AI tools, include `AI_PROMPTS.md`
   - Show your prompts and how you refined them

## ✅ Evaluation Criteria

### Must Have (Pass/Fail):
- ✅ Plugin installs and runs without errors
- ✅ Solves a real, identifiable problem
- ✅ At least 3 core components implemented
- ✅ Basic documentation (README, usage examples)
- ✅ Demo showing it working

### What Differentiates Good from Excellent:
- **Problem Quality**: Does it solve a meaningful pain point?
- **Implementation Quality**: Is the code clean and maintainable?
- **AI Integration**: Are prompts well-designed? Proper guards in place?
- **Developer Experience**: Is it intuitive? Good error messages?
- **Documentation**: Clear explanation of design decisions?
- **Innovation**: Creative solutions? Novel approaches?
- **Production-Readiness**: Error handling, edge cases, reliability?

## 🤖 AI Coding Assistants

**At Smartr, we actively encourage and embrace AI-assisted development.** Use Claude Code itself, GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, or any AI tools you prefer.

**If you use AI coding assistants:**
- Keep a log of your prompts and interactions
- Include this log in your submission (`AI_PROMPTS.md`)
- Reflect on how AI helped your process

We're interested in seeing:
- How you prompt AI tools effectively
- How you validate and refine AI-generated code
- Your ability to critically evaluate AI suggestions
